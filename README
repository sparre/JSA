## License

The Ada packages supplied in this repository are distributed under the ISC
license, unless something else is noted in the individual files.


## Testing

    make test

runs the included test suite.


### Included tests

The repository comes with two ready-to-use test cases:

1) 'cyclomatic_complexity' - reports excessive cyclomatic complexities in the
   project sources.

2) 'unused_units' - warns about units which aren't compiled.


## Building

    make build

builds all the packages in the repository, but the intended use is to include
the sources of the library in your project and compiling on demand.
